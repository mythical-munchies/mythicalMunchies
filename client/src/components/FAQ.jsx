              recipes that are as magical as they are delicious. From unicorn

              Not at all! While some of our recipes may call for exotic
              ingredients like phoenix feathers or mermaid scales, we understand
              that not everyone has a dragon's hoard of treasures at their
              disposal. That's why we provide easy-to-follow substitutions for
              those hard-to-find items.

              Of course! We take food safety very seriously here at Mythical
              Munchies. Our recipes undergo rigorous testing by both mortal and
              immortal taste testers to ensure that they're not only delicious
              but also safe for consumption. However, we cannot be held
              responsible for any unexpected side effects, such as temporary
              invisibility or spontaneous levitation.

              However, if you're willing to trade us a portal to your world in
              exchange for some enchanted cookies, we might be able to work
              something out.
