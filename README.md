## Install Instructions 
If you wish to run this application locally, here are the install notes.

1. First you will need to clone this repository.
    git@github.com:mythical-munchies/mythicalMunchies.git

2. Next you will need to navigate to the backend directory, then install Node.
    npm install

3. You will also want to copy .env.example as a .env file, but with your key values. cp .env.example .env

4. Within this terminal and run either of these command groups: 
  - Individual commands (must run in order) in package.json
       
You can also elect to run npm run rebuild as that is a custom script within package.json to run all of the above commands in order. This is found at line 14 in in backend/package.json.
 -- npm run rebuild

5. While in the backend directory, you will start the application.
    npm run start

6. Open a new terminal in the frontend directory so that the backend is live and install dependencies there.
    npm i

7. In this frontend directory, then start the React frontend server.
    npm run dev

8. In a new frontend directory, run npm run build which will trigger vite to build. The original command for this is vite build --watch. The --watch flag will trigger a rebuild when changes are made to vite.config.js as well as any bundled files. This is found at line 8 in frontend/package.json.
    npm run build

9. If Vite does not automatically open a tab in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:5173/.

10. You are all set to run Mythical Munchies on your local machine!
